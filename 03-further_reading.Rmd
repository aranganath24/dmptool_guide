# Additional Resources

The Digital Curation Center (DCC) offers a useful [checklist](https://www.dcc.ac.uk/sites/default/files/documents/resource/DMP_Checklist_2013.pdf) that can be useful to consider as you draft your DMP. In addition, the Inter-university Consortium for Social and Political Research (ICPSR), has assembled a useful page that links to a variety of resources that pertain to the topic of data management plans. It is available [here](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/pages/datamanagement/dmp/resources.html#a03). While ICPSR is dedicated to social science research, many of the resources it links to on that page are of more general interest. 

If you have specific questions about your particular DMP, please contact CRDDS and arrange for a consultation.
